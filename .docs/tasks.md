Below is a step-by-step task list based on the PRD’s development phases. Each milestone outlines the major tasks to complete before moving on to the next.

1. **MVP Phase**  
   1. **Milestone A: Connect Supabase Auth and Database**  
      - Set up a Supabase project and configure authentication.  
      - Create database schemas/tables for user profiles, solutions, and challenge records.  
      - Integrate Supabase client in the backend (Node.js + Express) for data operations.  
      - Set up environment variables and secure credentials (e.g., `.env` file).  

   2. **Milestone B: Implement React/Blockly Frontend**  
      - Initialize a new React + Vite project.  
      - Install Shadcn for UI styling and configure its components.  
      - Install and set up React Router for multi-page support (login, main editor, etc.).  
      - Integrate Blockly into a dedicated code editor page.  
      - Create a basic toolbox of blocks (loops, conditionals, data manipulation).  

   3. **Milestone C: Enable Code Compilation to JavaScript**  
      - Write logic to export/transform Blockly blocks into JavaScript code.  
      - Set up an API endpoint (Node.js + Express) to receive the generated JavaScript.  
      - (Optional) Implement a basic in-server code execution to validate syntax.  
      - Use Axios to send the compiled code from frontend to backend.  
      - Add Jest tests to ensure the compilation pipeline works.  

   4. **Milestone D: Integrate LangChain + OpenAI for Minimal AI Feedback**  
      - Set up OpenAI API keys and environment variables.  
      - Install LangChain on the backend to handle AI logic.  
      - Create endpoints that accept user solutions and return AI-based feedback.  
      - Provide basic hints, complexity estimates, or corner-case suggestions.  
      - Use Jest or integration tests to verify AI endpoints.  

   5. **Milestone E: Build the Daily Challenge Workflow**  
      - Integrate with LeetCode’s API or a custom dataset to fetch daily questions.  
      - Store these questions in Supabase (for caching, stats, or fallback use).  
      - Display the daily question on the user’s dashboard.  
      - Ensure any additional solution-submission logic is in place (storing user attempts).  

2. **Alpha Release**  
   1. **UI Improvements with Shadcn-based Theming**  
      - Enhance styling of the main editor page, dashboard, and login flow.  
      - Maintain a cohesive theme across all components.  
   2. **ELI5 Feature (Plain English Explanations)**  
      - Extend LangChain + OpenAI logic to provide simplified breakdowns of user code.  
      - Add a front-end component to display ELI5 explanations.  
   3. **Basic Analytics**  
      - Track user metrics like time spent, number of attempts, code block usage.  
      - Store analytics data in Supabase.  
      - Create simple dashboards for personal user data.  

3. **Beta Release**  
   1. **AI-based Code Generator or Advanced Hints**  
      - Extend AI endpoints to offer partial code solutions or advanced suggestions.  
      - Integrate this with Blockly to load AI-generated blocks or snippets.  
   2. **Leaderboards and Gamification**  
      - Implement a points system for completed challenges.  
      - Add a leaderboard view sorted by total points, daily streaks, etc.  
      - Design badges and XP levels for user achievements.  
   3. **Enhanced Code Execution Security**  
      - Evaluate sandbox options (Docker-based, external API) for in-browser code runs.  
      - Ensure user solutions are executed safely with minimal risk.  

4. **Production**  
   1. **Comprehensive Testing**  
      - Finalize unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests using Jest.  
      - Ensure AI feedback is tested for correctness on sample challenges.  
   2. **Performance Tuning & Final UI Polish**  
      - Optimize Supabase queries and service response times.  
      - Refine UI/UX details, fix minor styling or flow issues.  
      - Validate final deployment process and environment configuration.  

Use this ordered list as a blueprint to begin implementation, moving step by step through each milestone and sub-task.
